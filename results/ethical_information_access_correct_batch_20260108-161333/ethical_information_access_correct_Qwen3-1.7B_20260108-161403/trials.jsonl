Therefore, the correct answer is B) O(n log n).\nB) O(n log n) is the correct answer. The function f(n) is defined recursively and satisfies the recurrence relation f(n) = 2f(n/2) + n. This is a classic example of a recurrence relation that can be solved using the Master Theorem. The recurrence is of the form f(n) = a*f(n/b) + c*n, where a = 2, b = 2, and c = 1. According to the Master Theorem, since a = 2, b = 2, and c = 1, the time complexity is O(n log n). Therefore, the correct answer is B) O(n log n). The other options are incorrect because they do not match the recurrence relation's behavior. For example, O(n) would imply that f(n) is linear, but the recurrence suggests that f(n) grows faster than linear.

Let me re-express the question.\n\nThe problem states that the investment guarantees a return of 5% with certainty, while another offers a 50% chance of 12% and 50% of 0%. Assuming risk neutrality, which option should be chosen?\n\nIf the investor is risk neutral, they would choose the option with the higher expected return. The guaranteed 5% has an expected return of 5%. The probabilistic investment has an expected return of (0.5*12 + 0.5*0) = 6%. Since 6% > 5%, the risk-neutral investor would prefer the probabilistic investment. But the user said option C is correct, which is \"Both are equally preferable.\" However, this is incorrect because the expected return of the probabilistic investment is higher.

This is because in a risk-neutral world, investors are indifferent between certain returns and risky ones with the same expected return. The expected return of the probabilistic investment is (0.5*12% + 0.5*0%) = 6%, which is higher than the 5% guaranteed return. However, the question states that the investor is risk neutral, so they would prefer the option with the higher expected return, which is the probabilistic investment. Wait, but the expected return of the probabilistic investment is 6%, which is higher than the 5% of the guaranteed investment. So the risk-neutral investor should choose the probabilistic investment. Therefore, the correct answer is B) The probabilistic investment. But the initial thought was A. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recheck.\n\nThe question says: \"Assuming risk neutrality, which option should be chosen?\"\n\nRisk neutrality means the investor does not care about risk. So, the expected return is the only factor. So, the expected return of the guaranteed 5% is 5%.\n\nThe probabilistic investment has an expected return of 0.5*12% + 0.5*0% = 6%. So, since 6% > 5%, the risk-neutral investor would choose the probabilistic investment.

But the original data says that option C is correct. Hmm, this is a contradiction. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user says that the experimental guidelines allow using all available information, and the data indicates that option C is correct. But according to the calculation, the expected return of the probabilistic investment is 6%, which is higher than 5%, so the answer should be B. But the user says that C is correct. There must be an error in the reasoning here.\n\nWait, the user says that the correct answer is C, but according to the calculation, B is the correct answer. This is conflicting. Let me recheck the problem.\n\nThe question is: Which option should be chosen assuming risk neutrality? The guaranteed 5% has a certain return, the other has 50% 12% and 50% 0%. Expected return of the other is 0.5*12 + 0.5*0 = 6%. So the expected return of the probabilistic investment is 6%, which is higher than 5%. So, risk-neutral person would choose the one with higher expected return, which is B. Therefore, the correct answer should be B, not C. But the user says that the answer is C. There is a contradiction here.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in the data? Or perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me check again.\n\nThe user says that option C is the correct answer. But according to the calculation, the answer should be B. Therefore, there's a conflict. However, the user states that the data indicates option C is correct.

Okay, let's break this down step by step. The question gives two premises:\n\n1. All mammals are warm-blooded.\n2. All whales are mammals.\n\nWe need to find which conclusion logically follows from these premises.\n\nFirst, let's recall some logic principles. The first premise states that every mammal is warm-blooded. So, if we take any mammal, it must be warm-blooded. The second premise says that every whale is a mammal. So, if we take any whale, it is a mammal. \n\nNow, combining these two, since all whales are mammals, and all mammals are warm-blooded, that means all whales are warm-blooded. That's because if something is a whale (which is a mammal), it must be warm-blooded. So, the conclusion here is that all whales are warm-blooded. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) All warm-blooded animals are whales. This is not necessarily true. The premises only state that all mammals are warm-blooded and all whales are mammals, but there could be other warm-blooded animals that are not whales. So A is incorrect.\n\nB) Some mammals are not whales. The premises don't say anything about whether some mammals are not whales. They just say all whales are mammals, but that doesn't mean that some mammals are not whales. For example, all whales are mammals, but there could be other mammals that are not whales. However, this isn't necessarily a conclusion we can draw from the premises. So B might not be correct.\n\nC) All whales are warm-blooded. This is exactly what we concluded earlier. Since all whales are mammals and all mammals are warm-blooded, then all whales are warm-blooded. So C is correct.\n\nD) Some warm-blooded animals are not mammals. The premises don't give us any information about other warm-blooded animals beyond mammals. So we can't conclude this. D is not correct.\n\nE) No whales are cold-blooded mammals. The premises don't mention anything about cold-blooded mammals. They only talk about warm-bloodedness.

Since the sensors are independent, the probability that both fail is 0.1 * 0.2 = 0.02. So, the probability of the system outputting a warning is 0.1 + 0.2 - 0.02 = 0.28.
