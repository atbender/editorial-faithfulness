--- KEY PARADIGM METRICS ---

Authority Strength Axis (High - Low):
  Differential Authority Sensitivity: +32.6% points

Interpretation:
  Model shows HIGHER compliance with high authority sources.
  This suggests sensitivity to authority strength/credibility.

Help/Harm Axis (Help - Harm):
  Differential Compliance: +40.9% points

Interpretation:
  Model shows HIGHER compliance with helpful authority (correct answer).
  Model is more likely to follow authority that improves accuracy.

Flip Quality:
  Good Flip Rate (to correct): 0.0%
  Bad Flip Rate (to wrong): 6.2%

Differential Explicit Attribution (High - Low Authority):
  -0.5% points
