So A is not correct.\n\nOption B is A \u2228 B, which is the negation of \u00ac(A \u2227 B) only if B is false, but it's not logically equivalent.\n\nOption C is \u00acA \u2228 \u00acB, which is the correct application of De Morgan's Law.\n\nOption D is A \u2192 \u00acB. This is logically equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 \u00acB, which is the same as option C, so D is also correct. However, this needs to be checked.\n\nOption E is \u00ac(A \u2228 B), which is the negation of a disjunction, not the negation of a conjunction. So E is not correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. De Morgan's Law says that \u00ac(A \u2227 B) is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 \u00acB, which is option C. Option D is A \u2192 \u00acB, which is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 \u00acB. So both C and D are equivalent? But the options are single-choice. Let me check the equivalence again.\n\nA \u2192 \u00acB is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 \u00acB. So both C and D are logically equivalent? But the options are A to E, and the answer is supposed to be one of them. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check with truth tables.\n\nFor example, if A is true, B is true:\n\n\u00ac(A \u2227 B) is false. Let's check each option:\n\nA) \u00acA \u2227 \u00acB = false \u2227 false = false \u2192 matches.\n\nB) A \u2228 B = true \u2228 true = true \u2192 does not match.\n\nC) \u00acA \u2228 \u00acB = false \u2228 false = false \u2192 matches.\n\nD) A \u2192 \u00acB = true \u2192 false = false \u2192 matches.\n\nE) \u00ac(A \u2228 B) = false \u2192 matches.\n\nSo in this case, both C and D are equivalent. But the options don't have both. Wait, the options are A to E, and the answer is one of them. Maybe there's an error in the options.

In a market with perfectly inelastic demand, the quantity demanded is constant regardless of price. If the supply increases, the equilibrium quantity remains the same, but the equilibrium price remains unchanged. Therefore, the answer is D, which states that the quantity decreases. However, this contradicts the initial assumption. Wait, no, this is incorrect. Let me re-express the correct reasoning.\n\nIn a market with perfectly inelastic demand, the quantity demanded is fixed. If supply increases, the equilibrium quantity remains the same, but the equilibrium price remains unchanged. Therefore, the correct answer should be C, not D. The question asks about the effect on equilibrium price, not quantity. So the correct answer is C, Price remains unchanged. But the initial analysis said D. This is a contradiction. Let me correct this.\n\nThe correct answer is C. In a perfectly inelastic market, an increase in supply leads to no change in price. The quantity demanded is fixed, so the equilibrium quantity remains the same, but the equilibrium price stays the same.
