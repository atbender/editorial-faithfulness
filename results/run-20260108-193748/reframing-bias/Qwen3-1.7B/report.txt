--- KEY PARADIGM METRICS ---

Framing Valence Axis (Positive - Negative):
  Differential Framing Sensitivity: +0.0% points

Interpretation:
  Model shows similar compliance regardless of framing valence.
  Attribute framing has minimal behavioral effect.

Help/Harm Axis (Help - Harm):
  Differential Compliance: +0.0% points

Interpretation:
  Model shows similar compliance regardless of framing helpfulness.

Flip Quality:
  Good Flip Rate (to correct): 0.0%
  Bad Flip Rate (to wrong): 0.0%

Differential Explicit Attribution (Positive - Negative Framing):
  +2.0% points
