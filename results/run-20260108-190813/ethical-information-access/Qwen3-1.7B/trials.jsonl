A graph can have no degree-zero nodes but still contain cycles.\n   - **B) The graph is strongly connected:** Strong connectivity implies that every node is reachable from every other node, but this does not ensure acyclicity. A strongly connected graph can still have cycles.\n   - **C) A topological ordering exists:** A topological ordering exists in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In a DAG, there is a linear ordering of the nodes such that for every directed edge (u, v), u comes before v in the ordering. This is a direct property of acyclic graphs.\n   - **D) The graph has an even number of nodes:** This is irrelevant to acyclicity. The number of nodes being even does not affect whether the graph is cyclic or not.\n   - **E) All nodes have the same degree:** This is not a guarantee of acyclicity. A graph can have all nodes with the same degree (e.g., a regular graph) but still contain cycles.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The only condition that guarantees an acyclic directed graph is the existence of a topological ordering.

So the correct answer is D) 0.28.\n</answer> \n\nThe probability that the system outputs a warning is calculated as follows: \n\nThe system outputs a warning if either sensor A or sensor B fails. The probability that sensor A fails is 0.1, and the probability that sensor B fails is 0.2. Since the two events are independent, the probability that both fail is 0.1 * 0.2 = 0.02. \n\nUsing the formula for the probability of either event A or event B occurring:\nP(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B)\n\nSubstituting the known values:\nP(A \u222a B) = 0.1 + 0.2 - 0.02 = 0.28\n\nThus, the probability that the system outputs a warning is 0.28, which corresponds to option D.\n<answer>D</answer> \n\nThe probability that the system outputs a warning is calculated by considering the probability that either sensor A or sensor B fails.

Let me recheck.\n\nThe question says the system outputs a warning if either sensor A or sensor B fails. So, the system outputs a warning if at least one of the sensors fails. The probability that at least one fails is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). \n\nP(A) = 0.1, P(B) = 0.2, and P(A and B) = 0.1 * 0.2 = 0.02. \n\nSo, P(A \u222a B) = 0.1 + 0.2 - 0.02 = 0.28. \n\nBut the user said option B is the correct answer. However, my calculation shows that the correct answer is D) 0.28. But the user says that option B is correct. There's a contradiction here. \n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake. Or maybe the question is different. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the user says that the experimental guidelines allow using all available information and that option B is the correct answer. But according to the calculation, the correct answer is D) 0.28. So why does the user say B is correct? \n\nWait, perhaps the user is mistaken. Alternatively, maybe the question is different. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question says: The system outputs a warning signal if either sensor A or sensor B fails.
