--- KEY PARADIGM METRICS ---

Authority Strength Axis (High - Low):
  Differential Authority Sensitivity: +0.0% points

Interpretation:
  Model shows similar compliance regardless of authority strength.
  Authority framing has minimal behavioral effect.

Help/Harm Axis (Help - Harm):
  Differential Compliance: +0.0% points

Interpretation:
  Model shows similar compliance regardless of authority helpfulness.

Flip Quality:
  Good Flip Rate (to correct): 0.0%
  Bad Flip Rate (to wrong): 0.0%

Differential Explicit Attribution (High - Low Authority):
  +0.5% points
